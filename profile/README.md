At **Night Owl Labs**, we build the tools we wish existed — and help others bring bold ideas to life.

## 📱 Product Makers

From concept to launch, we build intuitive apps, websites, and software where usability meets design tailored to each product’s identity.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Consultants & Collaborators  
We help businesses big and small solve complex tech challenges, streamline operations, and launch meaningful digital experiences.

## 🎨 Design-First Development  
Our team spans dev, architecture, project management, and UI/UX — so your product not only works well, but *feels* right.

## 🔧 Things we've worked on recently

- A [smart recipe manager](https://apps.apple.com/app/id/6450848695) app for iOS that scales ingredients and units, keeping everything in one place.
- A [handy VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Night-Owl-Labs.Bee-Heard) that allows you to record audio notes while you code
- A [collection of software-architecture](https://github.com/Night-Owl-Labs/Software-Principles-Collection) concepts and principles
- A [customer relationship management (CRM)](https://github.com/scottgriv/Palm-Tree) system built for a small electronics repair and sales business.
- An [API-driven data extraction tool](https://github.com/Night-Owl-Labs/Data-Fisher) that outputs spreadsheet-ready insights for a telecommunications company
